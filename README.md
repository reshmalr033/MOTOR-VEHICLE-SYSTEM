# MOTOR-VEHICLE-SYSTEM
Motor vehicle system is a website which is developed for motor vehicle department. In this website all the users must register the details of their vehicles. The users will be provided a card which consists of a QR code. That QR code stores the details of the vehicle which includes the details of RC book, license, insurance, pollution details etc. It can be scanned using mobile phone camera of a vehicle inspector. Motor vehicle system is linked to bank account and hence the amount will be deducted from that particular bank account. This is developed using PHP and MySQL.
During travelling, the owner of a vehicle need not carry any documents regarding their vehicle. They have to keep only the card. When vehicle inspector comes for checking, the user must show the card. If the authorities find any rule violation, a certain amount of fine is levied from their bank account. The vehicle passes through a tollbooth, the QR code gets scanned through mobile camera and during that time the toll is taken. This system records the number of vehicles which passes through a road and the vehicle inspector can access the data of vehicles which passes through tollbooth.
